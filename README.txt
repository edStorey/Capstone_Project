Included in this submission is:

- The original proposal, proposal.pdf

- The full project report, project_report.pdf

- The Jupyter notebook files, all python code, images and other related files to the project are contained within the folder /code_files/

- The original MATLAB data structs alongside MATLAB scripts written for use in this project are contained iwthin the folder /MATLAB_supporting_data/


In folder /code_files/Capstone_Project/ 4 folders are empty: train, test, tran_32x32, test_32x32.
These folder contained the training and testing data but could nto be included due to space restrictions.

All data used in this project can be found at: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/

If the code is run only the relevant .png files can exist in these folders all other files included in the dataset must be moved to another directory.
